Topsy Example Theme
===================

This theme is based on the bootstrap theme starter kit in its simplest configuration
with a couple of minor changes to support the Tops Module.  It is intended as an example for other tops based
theme installation

The changes for Tops are
1) In template.php,
     the topsy_status_messages function inserts a KnockoutJS component element for ViewModel pages that is required
     for display of service response messages.
     This is a required change.

2) In templates\page.tpl.php,
    Added one line at the end of the file to display trace messages.
    This is an optional change.
